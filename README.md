# Response-Time Game
This repository implements a Resonse-Time Meter written in VHDL that has been proven to be functional with the DE1-SOC. It has also been tested with Testbenches and ModelSim. This was an assignment for a [minor course on the Hogeschool Rotterdam](https://bitbucket.org/HR_ELEKTRO/hwp01/wiki/Home).

## Usage
See the 'reaction meter' example for more instructions.
