# Response-Time Game
This repository implements a Resonse-Time Meter written in VHDL that has been proven to be functional on the DE1-SOC and has been tested with Testbenches in ModelSim.

Two folders are particularly intresting. The [library folder](./lib) contains the written libraries for a pseudo random number generator, seven segment display and ws2812 leds. The [examples folder](./examples) combines these into one fun and robust response time measuring game. Check out the other README's for more information.

> This was an assignment for the [Hardware Programming course](https://bitbucket.org/HR_ELEKTRO/hwp01/wiki/Home) on the Hogeschool Rotterdam.
