# Seven-Segment Display
This folder contains a component that can be used to display a number on a Seven-Segement Display, or short as SSD.

## Interface
When ```EN``` is asserted, the number present on the 4-bit ```INP``` bus will be decoded into a control signal for the SSD connected to the 7-bit ```SEG``` bus.
